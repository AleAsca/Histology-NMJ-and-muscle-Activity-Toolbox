# Histology-NMJ-and-muscle-Activity-Toolbox
A set of Matlab codes to:
  - Reconstruct Muscle 3D structures from muscle histology slides in nd2/tiff.
  - Overlaps features listed in excel file (this program was tested using NMJ locations).
  - Estimate volume and longest side of the muscle.
  - Show distribution patterns of features in excel using voxel grid and density based analysis.
  - Overlap high density EMG (hdEMG) activity recorded from muscle with histology reconstruction using signal attenuation modelling.
  - Correlate hdEMG activity to feature location using a electrode based signal reconstruction.
